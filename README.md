# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project is a machine learning-based Heart Disease Prediction system. It analyzes patient health data to predict the likelihood of heart disease using various machine learning models.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple machine learning models implemented
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
- Visualization of key insights

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HeartDiseasePrediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd HeartDiseasePrediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Train multiple machine learning models.
3. Evaluate the model performance.
4. Use the trained model to predict heart disease based on input features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a publicly available heart disease dataset. It contains patient health parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other key indicators.

## Results

The model provides predictions on whether a patient is at risk of heart disease. The performance of different models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
