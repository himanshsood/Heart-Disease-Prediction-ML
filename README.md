Heart Disease Prediction
Overview
This project is a machine learning-based Heart Disease Prediction system. It analyzes patient health data to predict the likelihood of heart disease using various machine learning models.

Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Multiple machine learning models implemented

Model evaluation and performance comparison

Visualization of key insights

Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/HeartDiseasePrediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd HeartDiseasePrediction
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Usage
Load the dataset and preprocess the data.

Train multiple machine learning models.

Evaluate the model performance.

Use the trained model to predict heart disease based on input features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a publicly available heart disease dataset. It contains patient health parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other key indicators.

Results
The model provides predictions on whether a patient is at risk of heart disease. The performance of different models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
